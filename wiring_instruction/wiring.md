# Cable Wiring Instruction

- PURPOSE
    - This instruction describes the method for wiring shielded and unshielded cables properly. 
    - This instruction describes how to clamp wires.
    - This instruction describes how to wire motors and syringe pumps correctly.
    - This instruction describes how to check and debug wiring correctly.
    

- REFERENCE, MATERALS, AND EQUIPMENT 
    - need below tools and items for wiring
        1) Wire stripper
        2) Shielded cable stripper
        3) Wire crimper
        4) Female or male crimp contact pin
        5) Shielded or unshielded cables

    - need multi-meter for checking wires, setting continuity check mode like below.

    - have three types of cables
        1) igus chainflex CF240-PUR-03-04, 4 x 22 AWG

        3) R20007-1T, 2 x 22AWG


- PROCEDURE 
    - How to clamp wires
        - Strip shield of cable with the stripper like below.

        - Strip wires with wire stripper. Since we have 20AWG and 22AWG cables, you should strip the insulation, matching with wire size.

        - Place one of wires in crimp contact pin like below. Crimp contact pin has two cripming points. Insulation should be placed at the left crimping point and metal wire should be placed at the right crimping point.

        - Clamp two crimping points and check whether it is properly clamped by pulling  back the wire.

        - Insert male or female crimp pin into connector all the way, latching the crimp pin to small square hall at the connector like below.
